Handling POST request in nodejs and Python
When handling post requests in python flask or Django as well as NodeJS in express or Koa (or any other backend framework)

In flask, use request.get_json(force=True)

In express, use the middleware "app.use(express.json())"

When sending the POST request to your server, specify the MIME type : Content-Type : application/json 

This will help you successfully handle the requests. Good luck now myself . 👍👍👍
